# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
# PORTFOLIO
----------------------------------------------------------------------
##Employer Ask:

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
##Mock up:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
As I am starting my software engineer career I do not have sufficient projects to align into the mock up portfolio.

Per my instructors original instructions I was asigned this project as an exact replica of the mock-up provided above, we were later told we had creative liberties on this project. I will build upon the mock up as I grow in my CSS and HTML expertise and I am looking to eventually add some animation and JS with this project. I attempted to design the portfolio as a close resamble to the original with a few changes and additions like the button links to the projects.

WHEN portfolio is loaded, you will see my name, recent picture and a header with links navigating you to the corresponding sections of the page (about me, work, contact me).
WHEN you click on the link about my work, you will find titled images of my work. My first and only application will be displayed larger than the others.
When you hover over the images of my work, you will come across a "check it out" button linking you to the deployed project website.
When the page is resized media queries will re-adjust the page to make it more appealing and eligible for the reader.
