# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
# PORTFOLIO
----------------------------------------------------------------------
##Employer Ask:

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

##Mock up:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
As I am starting my software engineer career I do not have sufficient projects to align into the mock up portfolio.

Per my instructors original instructions I was asigned this project as an exact replica of the mock-up provided above, we were later told we had creative liberties on this project. I will build upon the mock up as I grow in my CSS and HTML expertise and I am looking to eventually add some animation and JS with this project. I attempted to design the portfolio as a close resamble to the original with a few changes and additions like the button links to the projects.
